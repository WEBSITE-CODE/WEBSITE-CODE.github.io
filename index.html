    <h1  class= "Title">How evaporation can be used to create a water filter</h1>
    <p class= "Intro">Making a water filter using evaporation is actually very simple. You will need:</p>
    <li class=  "List">A microwaveable bowl(seethrough if you have any- it would make the experiment easier)</li>
    <li class= "List">Cilng film, about 25cm in width and height-depends on how big your bowl is.</li>
    <li class= "List">Salt: 30-40g</li>
    <li class= "List">A micromave(you should already have one of these. Probably)</li>
    <p class= "Instructions">Read all of the instructions before doing them, or you might make a mistake.<br><br>  1. Mix together the salt and the water. Use the salt water to fill the bowl.<br><br>2. Warm it in the microwave for two minutes (unless it's a microwave oven, if it is, try and warm it until it steams slightly).<br><br>3. Cover it with cling film. Be careful- even the slightest gap could mean no water. Place on top one or two ice cubes on top.<br><br>4. Watch it <strong>like a hawk</strong> until lots of water droplets form on the cling film. Slowly remove the cling film, and take off the water.<br><br>5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 over and over. When the bowl turns cold, rewarm it. When you take out the last water drops, it will have been one or two hours.<br><br>6. Relax! You deserve a rest.</p>
